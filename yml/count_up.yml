# count_up.yml
#
# A simple VI that counts up until the user presses a "Stop" button.
#
# It has the following parts:
#   - a While Loop that runs until the user presses a Stop Button
#   - an LED indicator to show if it's running (wired to negated Stop Button value)
#   - a loop counter indicator wired up to the while loop's iteration terminal
#   - a small 100ms loop delay constant wired into a "Wait (ms)" timer
